    "# What is the purpose of cross-validation and how does it prevent overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross validation is a method that help us estimate the accuracy of predictive model.\n",
    "When training a machine learning or deep learning model we have to make sure that the model will work with a high precision in production.\n",
    "In that said environnement, the model will see observations and data he has probably never seen and still has to be quite precise on.\n",
    "Meaning that the model has to be well adjusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enforce that adjustement we use cross validation to split or resample our dataset and set a partir some testing data that our model will not see during its training. When the training is done we can use the portion of data that was set aside to evaluate our model and even compare it with other models to select the best performing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also helps prevent overfitting, which means that our model is too adjusted to our training data that it cannot predict anything else. Therefore cross validation will always help us control overfitting and detect the balance between high accuracy on training data vs low accuracy on testing (unseen) data."

    "# Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in simple terms. How does it affect model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance tradeoff is about balancing simplicity and complexity in machine learning.\n",
    "A high bias means that the model is too simple and will consistently miss the target values. This causes model to miss relevant relations between features and target.\n",
    "A high variance means the model is too complex and can cause a lot off unstability because our model is to sensitive to small fluctuations of values. PS: it's not because the model is complex that it needs to have a high variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tradeoff seeks to minimize both error sources that prevent a machine learning model to be generalized over the training set.\n",
    "The ideal is to train a model that both captures the regularities in the training set but also generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
    "Hence a accurate model on training set and precise model on testing, unseen, set\n",
    "\n",
    "see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model underfits which is likely a low bias (it captured the training set) but high variance because the test set is likely different from the train\n",
    "If a model overfits which means that it is too accustomed to the training set, it'll have a a lower variance because it spectrum is reduced to the training set but will have a high bias because it'll most likely having wrong on unseen a new data points."

    "\n",
    "recall is the capacity of a classification model to evaluate true positive which means a high tp and a low fn recall = tp / (tp + fn) (binary classification)\n",
    "precision is the capacity of the model to evaluate positives which a high tp and a low fp precision = tp / (tp+fp) (binary classification)\n",

    "\n",

    "The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for HTTP APIs.This allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface descriptions have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.\n",
