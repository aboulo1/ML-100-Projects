You can install them using the following command:'''bash'''pip install -r requirements.txt- **Installation**: Instructions on how to set up the environment, including installing dependencies. Provide a 'requirements.txt' or 'environment.yml' file for easy setup.#### 6. **Usage**'''markdown## UsageTo run the model training script:'''bashpython scripts/train_model.pypython scripts/predict.py --input data/sample_input.csv- **Usage**: Instructions on how to run the project. Include commands for training the model, making predictions, and any other relevant scripts.#### 7. **Model Performance**'''markdown## Model PerformanceThe model was evaluated using cross-validation and achieved the following metrics:- **Accuracy**: 95%- **Precision**: 96%- **Recall**: 94%- **F1-Score**: 95%## ResultsThe model successfully classifies iris flowers with high accuracy. The confusion matrix shows that the model performs well across all three classes, with very few misclassifications.## ConclusionsThe classification model performs well on the Iris dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of basic machine learning techniques on a well-structured dataset. This project serves as a solid foundation for more complex classification problems.## Future WorkPossible extensions of this project include:- Experimenting with more complex models like SVM or Random Forest.- Deploying the model using a web framework like Flask or FastAPI.- Applying the techniques learned here to a different dataset or problem.
