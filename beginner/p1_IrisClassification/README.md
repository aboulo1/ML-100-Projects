You can install them using the following command:'''bash'''pip install -r requirements.txt- **Installation**: Instructions on how to set up the environment, including installing dependencies. Provide a 'requirements.txt' or 'environment.yml' file for easy setup.#### **Model Prototyping**## Model prototypingIn scripts/ModelPrototyping.py you can see that we applied our preprocessing and tested 3 models.LinearRegression and RandomForest that had 100% accuracy and SVM that had 95%We decided to continue with it to have some interesting descision boundary plots and practice that.![TrainingBoundary](data/SVM_DB_train.png)![TestingBoundary](data/SVM_DB_test.png)## UsageTo run the model training script:'''bashpython scripts/train_model.pypython scripts/predict.py --input data/sample_input.csv- **Usage**: Instructions on how to run the project. Include commands for training the model, making predictions, and any other relevant scripts.#### **Model Performance**## Model PerformanceThe model was evaluated using cross-validation and achieved the following metrics:- **Accuracy**: 97%- **Precision**: 98%- **Recall**: 97%- **F1-Score**: 98%## ResultsThe model successfully classifies iris flowers with high accuracy. The confusion matrix shows that the model performs well across all three classes, with very few misclassifications.## ConclusionsThe classification model performs well on the Iris dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of basic machine learning techniques on a well-structured dataset. This project serves as a solid foundation for more complex classification problems.## Deploy Model### FastAPIin application/app.py we've built a fast api service to predict classes and render probabilitiesTo run in the "application" folder '''bashuvicorn app:fastapp --reloadWe've then created a docker image (see Dockerfile) at the root of this projectto build and run the docker image : run at the root of the project'''bashdocker build -t my-fast-api-app .docker run -d -p 8000:8000 my-fast-api-app## Project StructureThe project is organized into the following structure:### Explanation:- **`data/`**: Directory to store dataset files.- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and other prototyping tasks. Includes a notebook 'Fundamentals.ipynb' where theoretical answers are documented.- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts used for data processing, model training, and evaluation.- **`models/`**: Directory where serialized models (like '.pkl' or '.h5' files) are stored after training.- **`app/`**: Directory for application code, such as a Flask or FastAPI app, used to deploy the model.- **`README.md`**: The main project documentation, providing an overview and instructions.- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the dependencies required to run the project.- ** 'Dockerfile' ** : The dockerfile to create the image of our application to deploy on GCP
