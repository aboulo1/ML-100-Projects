# Titanic SurvivalThis project is part of a series of 100 machine learning projects aimed at building and deploying machine learning models. The goal of this project is to predict the survival probability of the Titanic passengers based on there attributes.In fact, it looks like some sorts of people were most likely to survive than others# True Goal## Table of Contents1.

You can install them using the following command:'''bash'''pip install -r requirements.txt- **Installation**: Instructions on how to set up the environment, including installing dependencies. #### **Model Prototyping**## Model prototypingIn scripts/ModelPrototyping.py you can see that we applied our preprocessing and tested 3 models.LinearRegression and RandomForest that had 100% accuracy and SVM that had 95%We decided to continue with it to have some interesting descision boundary plots and practice that.![TrainingBoundary](data/SVM_DB_train.png)![TestingBoundary](data/SVM_DB_test.png)#### **Model Performance**## Model PerformanceThe model was evaluated using cross-validation and achieved the following metrics:- **Accuracy**: 97%- **Precision**: 98%- **Recall**: 97%- **F1-Score**: 98%## ResultsThe model successfully classifies iris flowers with high accuracy. The confusion matrix shows that the model performs well across all three classes, with very few misclassifications.## ConclusionsThe classification model performs well on the Iris dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of basic machine learning techniques on a well-structured dataset. This project serves as a solid foundation for more complex classification problems.## Deploy Model### FastAPIin application/app.py we've built a fast api service to predict classes and render probabilitiesTo run in the "application" folder '''bashuvicorn app:fastapp --reload### DockerWe've then created a docker image (see Dockerfile) at the root of this projectto build and run the docker image : run at the root of the project'''bashdocker build -t my-fast-api-app .docker run -d -p 8000:8000 my-fast-api-appcheck errors : docker ps -adocker logs <logs>### GitHub Container RepositorySET GHCR1.

Includes a notebook 'Fundamentals.ipynb' where theoretical answers are documented.- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts used for data processing, model training, and evaluation.- **`models/`**: Directory where serialized models (like '.pkl' or '.h5' files) are stored after training.- **`app/`**: Directory for application code, such as a Flask or FastAPI app, used to deploy the model.- **`README.md`**: The main project documentation, providing an overview and instructions.- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the dependencies required to run the project.- ** 'Dockerfile' ** : The dockerfile to create the image of our application to deploy on GCP
